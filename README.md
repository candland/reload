## Usage

Starting the application. Below is an example of starting a jar and setting
the command line options needed for it to start new processes.

```bash
java -jar target/my-uberjar-standalone.jar \
  -d \
  -ePORT:5000 \
  -eENV:production \
  -l/apps/my/shared/log/production.log \
  -p/apps/my/shared/pids/my.pid \
  -c/apps/my/current/
```

There are two integration points, `-main` and the point where the application
is started and ready to start handling load.

In the main function, we initialize reload with the command to reload upon
signal. This should be the same command that is used to start the program 
initially with out the command line arguments. The args will be passed to 
the new process.


```clojure
(defn -main [& args]
  (let [command ["java" "-jar" "my-uberjar-standalone.jar"]]
    (reload/initialize command)
    (reload/run main-app args)
    )
  )
```


Restart Point, this is where we kill the other app and start doing work. I'm
using the (Component pattern from Stuart Sierra)
[https://github.com/stuartsierra/component] and do something like this:


```clojure
;; WebServer
(defrecord WebServer [handler-fn cache]

  component/Lifecycle

  (start [component]
    (let [
      handler (handler-fn cache)

      server (reload/clean-and-wait-for-port! 
                (:port config) 
                (run-jetty-fn config handler))]

      (assoc component :server server, :handler handler)
      )
    ) 

  (stop [component]
    (when-not (nil? (:server component))
      (.stop (:server component))
      )
    (dissoc component :server)
    )
  )
```

The `clean-and-wait-for-port!` will kill the currently running process and 
wait for the port to become available. This takes a few milliseconds.
